      "description": "In this episode, we discuss how UEFA, Instagram and other social media ruined the epic Euro 24 celebration during a The Killers concert. The show was paused to broadcast the last minutes of the semi-final between England and the Netherlands at the London stadium, resulting in England's victory. Fans, while celebrating and filming the moment, had their accounts banned when they captured the game broadcast in the background. An epic gratuitous \"commercial\" that became a huge headache.\n\nAdditionally, we explore Japan's decision to destroy millions of vending machines due to the creation of a new banknote that will render them inoperable, highlighting the challenges for companies with legacy software. We also address how Brazilian companies such as Ambev and Ipiranga are transforming into banks, after receiving authorization from the Central Bank, and how this impacts the market.\n\nFinally, we present our new project, showing how it is possible to set up a company from scratch without any employees, using only market tools and artificial intelligence.\n\n00:00:00 PRESENTATION\n00:01:12 UEFA SPOILS EURO 24 PARTY \n00:14:28 JAPAN DESTROYS VENDING MACHINES (DISCUSSION ON LEGACY SOFTWARE)\n00:27:30 ARE AMBEV AND IPIRANGA THE NEW \"BANKS\" ON THE MARKET? \n00:33:10 HOW TO SET UP A BUSINESS USING AI AND MARKET TOOLS\n00:49:49 CLOSING\n\n#Euro24 #TheKillers #UEFA #InstagramBan #Japan #VendingMachines #SoftwareLegado #Ambev #Ipiranga #IA #StartupNegÃ³cios",
